## Abstract
Quick Response (QR) codes seem to appear everywhere these days. We can see them on posters, magazine ads, websites, product packaging and so on. Using the QR codes is one of the most intriguing ways of digitally connecting consumers to the internet via mobile phones since the mobile phones have become a basic necessity thing of everyone. In this paper, we present a methodology for creating QR codes by which the users enter text into a web browser and get the QR code generated. Drupal module was used in conjunction with the popular libqrencode C library to develop user interface on the web browser and encode data in a QR Code symbol. The experiment was conducted using single and multiple lines of text in both English and Thai languages. The result shows that all QR encoding outputs were successfully and correctly generated.

## Introduction
QR Code is two-dimensional barcode which is categorized in matrix barcode that can store data information. QR stands for “Quick Response” as the creator intended the code to allow its contents to be decoded at high speed. It is introduced in Japan by Denso Corporation in 1994. This kind of barcode was initially used for tracking inventory in vehicle parts manufacturing and is now used in a variety of industries. Nowadays, mobile phones with built-in camera are wildly used to recognize the QR code. There have been many URL shortening services that automatically generate QR code links to websites such as Goo.gl and Bit.ly. Goo.gl is the first introduced URL shortening service that provides automatically generates QR codes. only 12 days after introducing Goo.gl, Bit.ly launched the same service. The URL shortening service shortens link and turn it into a QR code that, when scanned with a mobile QR code reader, automatically direct users to the shortened link. It really shows that QR codes are going to become more and more popular. To create a QR code via goo.gl, simply visit goo.gl and type in a URL address, then click the “Shorten” button. The shorten link http://goo.gl/H3xr will show up as shown in Fig. 1. If we copy http://goo.gl/H3xr into a new browser window and append “.qr” to the end of the link as: http://goo.gl/H3xr.qr, the QR code will be shown. Now you can then print out, send to your friends via e-mail, post on your blog, etc. If we do the same thing via bit.ly, the shorten link will show up and the QR code will be generated.
While the ability to create QR codes via URL shortening services is not revolutionary in any sense, it is a fun feature that should increase interest and familiarity with QR codes, which continue to grow in popularity among marketers. 

## Problem statement
Many businesses and individuals require QR codes for various purposes such as marketing, product labeling, and event promotion. However, the process of generating QR codes can be complex and time-consuming, particularly for those without technical expertise. Existing QR code generators are often limited in terms of customization options, file formats, and data types, which can lead to suboptimal results. Some require sign ups to use. Moreover, some QR code generators may not be user-friendly, making it challenging for users to preview and adjust their QR codes before exporting them. These issues can lead to suboptimal QR codes, which may not function correctly or fail to achieve their intended purpose. Therefore, there is a need for a reliable and user-friendly QR code generating tool that can provide customizable options, easy-to-use interface, and generate high-quality QR codes for various data types and file formats.
This project seeks to address that by creating an easy to use QR code that user do not need to sign up or provide their personal information to use.

With No sign ups needed, it becomes hard for users to save their work for future use. Or trace their work. 

## Requirements/tools:

GitHub repository with README.md and starter files.
Text editor/coding environment setup for HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT

## Process:
Using git commands, clone to local machines and create a branch to avoid merge conflicts with the main branch.
Change directory to location of the repository.
Switch to the dev branch and work with starter files.

## Development (Using html(ejs)/CSS/Javascript)
Write codes for pages and features (including: Landing page, Sign up/log in page, dashboard, process page, documentation page, how it works, contact us page ) using style guides from the design team.
Work on the responsiveness for different device views.
